              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                HyperNod (&quot;HyperNod&quot;, &quot;we&quot;,
                &quot;us&quot;, or &quot;our&quot;) is a technology startup
                based in {SITE.address}. This Privacy Policy explains what
                information we collect through{" "}
                <strong>{SITE.url.replace("https://", "")}</strong>, how we
                use it, and the choices you have. It applies to this website
                only — if you become a client, the specific infrastructure or
                platform work we do for you is governed separately by the
                agreement we sign with you.
              </p>

              <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                We collect information in two ways: information you give us
                directly, and limited technical information collected
                automatically when you visit the site.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Contact form submissions.</strong> When you use the
                  contact form or email us directly, we receive the name,
                  email address, and message you provide, so we can respond
                  to your inquiry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Basic technical data.</strong> Like most websites,
                  our hosting infrastructure automatically logs standard
                  technical information (such as IP address, browser type,
                  and pages requested) for security and reliability purposes.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
              <p>
                This website does not use advertising or analytics cookies,
                and we do not run third-party tracking scripts. Your browser
                may store small amounts of data locally (for example, to
                remember a UI preference), but we do not use this to track
                you across other websites. If that changes in the future,
                we&apos;ll update this policy and, where required, ask for
                your consent.
              </p>

              <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>To respond to messages sent through the contact form or by email.</li>
                <li>To understand and improve how our website performs and to keep it secure.</li>
                <li>To communicate with you about a project or engagement you&apos;ve inquired about.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We do not sell your personal information, and we do not
                share it with third parties for their own marketing
                purposes.
              </p>

              <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
              <p>
                We may share information with service providers who help us
                run our infrastructure and communications (for example, our
                hosting and email providers), solely to the extent needed to
                operate this website and respond to you. We may also
                disclose information if required to by law, or to protect
                the rights, property, or safety of HyperNod or others.
              </p>

              <h2>Data Retention</h2>
              <p>
                We keep contact form submissions and related correspondence
                for as long as reasonably necessary to respond to your
                inquiry and maintain a record of client communications, after
                which it is deleted or anonymized.
              </p>

              <h2>Your Rights</h2>
              <p>
                You can ask us to tell you what information we hold about
                you, correct it, or delete it, by contacting us using the
                details below. We will respond to reasonable requests within
                a reasonable timeframe.
              </p>

              <h2>Data Security</h2>
              <p>
                We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to
                protect the information we hold, consistent with how we
                build infrastructure for our clients. No method of
                transmission or storage is completely secure, so we
                can&apos;t guarantee absolute security.
              </p>

              <h2>Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                This website is intended for businesses and professionals.
                We do not knowingly collect information from children.
              </p>

              <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
              <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to
                reflect changes to our website or practices. The
                &quot;Last updated&quot; date above reflects the most recent
                revision.
              </p>

              <p>

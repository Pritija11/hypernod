              <p>
                These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your use of
                the HyperNod website at{" "}
                <strong>{SITE.url.replace("https://", "")}</strong> and your
                interactions with HyperNod (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;,
                &quot;our&quot;), a technology startup based in{" "}
                {SITE.address}. By using this website, you agree to these
                Terms. If you don&apos;t agree, please don&apos;t use the
                site.
              </p>

              <h2>Description of Services</h2>
              <p>
                HyperNod builds and manages cloud infrastructure, digital
                platforms, and technology solutions for businesses. This
                website describes those services and allows you to get in
                touch with us. Any actual engagement for infrastructure
                management, platform development, or related work is
                governed by a separate agreement (a proposal, statement of
                work, or service contract) entered into directly between
                HyperNod and the client, which takes precedence over these
                Terms for that engagement.
              </p>
